<p align="justify">Cricket was brought to India in the early 1700s, with the first documented insurance of cricket being played in 1721. 
At the time of its introduction, it was used as a medium for Indians to integrate into British cultural norms.
 By serving as a bridge between the two groups, it made assimilating much easier. In its early time in India, it was
 played and used by Indian elites to gain favor with the British which not only aided in the value of the sport due to
 its association with the elite but its high status helped it spread throughout India. Although it began as a foreign
 sport, the sport ultimately became associated with India and began to play a role in India's identity. In the late 1800s,
 cricket's image began to move away from being an exclusively upper class sport as players from lower castes and underprivileged 
 communities began to play and make their mark.
